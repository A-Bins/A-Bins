Hi! My name is Bins, and I am the creator of the Minecraft server for players and I will make the game using Unreal Engine!

I started learning Java in late 2020 and, while working on it, I discovered a passion that I never knew I had, it was programming!

When I didn't learn programming, I didn't know what I could do well or what I loved doing.
But programming has now become my passion!


My planning server is The Outpost, which is inspired by "The Hunter: Call of the Wild"
I will keep my passion


Further notices :
I am using Kotlin for programming language ( Minecraft )
I hope to learn more languages in the future, which are Rust, C++ and Golang
