Hi! My name is Bins, and I am the creator of the Minecraft server for players and I will make the game using Unreal Engine near future!

I started learning Java in late 2020 and, while working on it, I discovered a passion that I never knew I had, it was programming!

When I had not learned programming, I didn't know what I could do well or what I loved doing.
But programming has now become my passion!

ㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡ

A server I have made is The Outpost inspired by "The Hunter: Call of the Wild"
I will keep my passion

If you want to know process of develop my servers,

Further notices :
I am using Kotlin for programming language ( Minecraft )
I hope to learn more languages in the future, which are Rust, C++ and Golang
